# Veggie List with Sveltekit and NestJs

## What's inside?

This repo contains an implementation of a test app based on sveltekit and nestjs. Both, the sveltekit app and the nestjs API are apps of a turborepo monorepo.

## Why?

We live in a small village at the coast of Ecuador. Every Wednesday our "Veggie Truck" comes to our house to deliver a box of fresh vegetables (and fruits). Because we are very modern here, the veggie truck driver receives our order via WhatsApp. So we send him every week a list of all vegetables and fruits we would like to order including their amounts in units, kilograms/grams, libras or dollars. To make the process easier and more exciting for us (and of course to play around with some cool frameworks like Sveltekit and NestJs) I decided to create this app. 

I hope you like it and enjoy it. 

### Build

To build the app, run the following command:

```
cd veggie-list
npm run build
```

### Develop

To join the development, run the following command:

```
cd veggie-list
npm run dev
```
